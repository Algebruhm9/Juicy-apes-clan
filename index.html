            We continued to expand year by year and are currently settling with 11 members in the team.
            All of us with an equal passion for gaming. Some more competitive than others but we all have 
            our shares of laughs and great moments together. By the end of high-school we all found our common
            games to be competitive in and go on to win a few matches and championships.

            for a couple of wins here and there. This year, we are after the golden trophy itself. Hence why we
            are all busy training and practicing everyday, learning new techniques and honing our skills. We 
            are not all the same so we do our best to grow our potential in whatever character or traits we have
            to better suit our needs. We're not all the same but we have many things in common, winning, is one of them.
